## Introduction

## The main menu

* "New Object" creates a new object on the stage. In the popup window, first a (unique) name must be entered[^object_naming]. Then the new object is placed on the stage from where it can be dragged to the desired position[^dd_multiple].
* "Export" opens the dialog for editing and export of the model.
  * "Rebuild from Json" loads the Json structure from the text box on the stage. This allows changes to be made directly on the model and (partial) models can be added by copy & paste.
  * "Sort objects internally" opens a sortable list of objects. This allows the order of the Abeitsbereiche in the backend change.
  * "Save Json Model" saves the model without it in the database and working model to convict. Thus, for between steps in the revision of the model hold without affecting the running operation.
  * "Export Json Model" writes Finally, the model database and working model. Here, then, is from the model reality! In the downstream model processing the changes to the database (as SQL queries) and links are output to the generated / updated PHP classes. Automatically created backup copies of the database and the old models allow the restoration of accidentally overwriting content.
* the Radar-Button opens a miniaturized Vies of the Stage. Here you can explore teh Objects on the stage and navigate by dragging the red "View-Box" to the target.
* "Help" opens finally this Document ;-) 

[^object_naming] : Objects whose name shall begin with an underscore are system internal (this has no technical reason)
[^dd_multiple] : Several boxes can be marked by shift + click and moved as a group (deactivated atm)

## Objects

An object is represented as a draggable box containing a sortable list of fields [^object_representation].
Tooltips reveal the function of each icon.


### Object Properties

#### Database

A data model in cms-kit can distribute its objects over multiple databases.
The databases are created with project setup and can be selected from the drop  down.

If objects are linked, they must be in the same database!
Objects that have been assigned to a different database are marked with a color code.
Thus it can be seen whether there is an invalid link.

#### Increment

This defines the method a new ID is generated for an entry.
Typically, the database-internal autoincrement function is used (a new entry gets the next highest ID number).
If data are distributed and have to be merged later this may lead to collisions (there are identical IDs created).
This can be prevented by (micro)timestamp-based IDs (plus a random number).

#### View

> "A view is the result set of a stored query on the data, which the database users can query just as they would in a persistent database collection object."[^viewdescription]

Views are usefull

* to show a compound object (a result of many tables or some calculations etc.) or
* to create a "clone" of an object in case you want to *create multiple connections* from one object to another one [^multiple_connections]

To create a view instead of a physical table simply put a SELECT-statement (the stored query) into the Field.
You also have to create the Fields in the object in order to show the results of the view in backend.

Please note: SqLite does not allow to write/update a view.

[^viewdescription]: See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_%28database%29> (2014-7-18)
[^multiple_connections]: To keep the ORM-classes clean and simple only one connection between two objects are allowed.
Sometimes however you will need multiple connections
(eg. an person-table needs multiple relations to a country-table in order to reflect the birth-place as well as the actual address).
In this case you can create a view of the physical country-table and additionally connect the person-table to this view.

#### Language labels

For output in the backend translations of the object name can be created.
Each translation begins with the country abbreviation followed by a colon and is written in a separate line.

Example:

	de:mein toller Bereich
	en:my great Section

#### Hooks

Hooks are Functions for pre- and post-processing of actions in backend.
This is usefull for filtering, ensuring data integrity of special objects and much more.
Available Hooks can be transferred from the dropdown in the field below.
If necessary there are parameters to supplement or adapt in square brackets.

Hook statements

* start with the information, whether they be called before (PRE) or after (PST) a backend event
* followed by a colon,
* the function name
* and, if available, separated with one another colon a list of parameters (comma separated)

Examples:

	PRE:ccopy:goOnline,draftField,outputField
	PRE:rollback

#### Wizard URLs

Wizard URLs can be in the backend to a global area (ie not an entry-bound) Wizards and information pages offer.
The Wizards can be accessed via the drop "user Wizards".
In the URL itself you also can add special placeholders that are automatically overwritten with the current values ​​in the backend
(in principle here any global javascript variable is available).

a selection:

    %projectName% of the current project name
    %objectName% is the name of the active object / area
    %objectId% the ID of the entry currently shown.
    %lang% backend language
    %userId% User ID

Example

	http:///my-website.com/doku/howto_create_content_%lang%.html

is translated in english language settings to

	http://my-website.com/doku/howto_create_content_en.html

GET-parameters are of course also translated (for dynamic content)

    extensions/bla/wizard1/?project=%projectName%&lang=%lang%

The available javascript variables in the backend can be shown with this bookmarklet (Save as bookmark and call it in backend

<a href="javascript:(function(){var%20v=[];for(e in window){if(typeof(window[e])=='string'){v.push(e)}};alert(v.join(', '))})();">getGlobalVars</a>

#### Preview URLs

Target of an entry out a preview to be called, can specify that here.
A preview URL works much like a wizard-URL with the difference that the call is placed on a button in the entry.
The URL should contain %objectId% as a parameter to reflect from whitch item the url is opened.


#### Hierarchy Type

Normally entries of an object are stored as non-hierarchical list that can be scrolled and sorted.
With this selectbox, you can decide whether the entries are hierarchically organized.

If elements are placed in a hierarchical structure, you have to define the object as a *tree* or *graph*.

##### Tree

The tree hierarchy allows a child node only one parent.
This type of hierarchy is suitable eg for forums or page trees.
Internally, this hierarchy utilizes the [nested set model](#).

##### Graph

The graph-hierarchy allows a child element (including its children) to hang on multiple parent elements. This hierarchy type is suitable eg for ontologies (category systems).
Internally, this hierarchy utilizes a [Transitive Closure Table](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transitive_closure) .

##### Tags

Tags are used in the backend for simple grouping of areas.
Thus, for example, only areas in the selection show, have the administrative functions or create groups to manage product groups.
Tags are of course also language-specific (an English user will not see any German tags).
Each Tag begins with the country abbreviation followed by a colon and is written in a separate line.

Example:

	de:Administration
	en:Admin-Section

##### Comment

Here you can enter an internal comment.

### Data fields

When creating a new object, a field named "id" is created automatically.
This field is necessary to refer  entries in the system unambiguously.
It may not be renamed. The "id" field contains two icons that allow the creation of relations to other objects (see "Relations").

Data fields can be created in the object using the symbol (+). This opens up a pop-up window where the field name must be entered.
The field name must not contain spaces or special characters and is normally written in lower case.
If the name is subsequently changed (eg directly in Json) it can lead to problems with existing data
(this is like deleting the old field and creating a new one).

"Magical" field-names in the backend

Some field-names have a specific meaning in the backend of cms-kit and should be chosen wisely!

* "...id": fields ending with "id" are for database IDs and will not be displayed in the backend.
* "...sort": ends a field to "sort" is also expected from a system-internal value and hidden field.
* "c_": field names, prepended by "c_" are automatically encrypted using Blowfish[^nosearch]! This is especially useful when the data (database) is passed on to external organizations. The input field should have a Wizard called "field password".
* "e_": prepended by "e_", content is base64-encoded. 

[^magicfields_in_backend] : the functions of Magical Field names are not stored in the database classes and are thus not automatically appliable to your own applications!

[^nosearch] : Encrypted field is not recognized by the internal search!


#### Generic models

If a field is assigned to a field of the file type "model" it is interpreted as a container for "Generic models". Additional to this Container, input fields can be defined. More to generic models [here](#).


### Settings for fields

Fields provide the following settings

#### Languages

Interfaces in the backend can be customized for each language corresponding translations of the field name.
Each translation begins with the country abbreviation followed by a colon *and is written in a separate line*.

Example of a simple Label:

	de:mein toller Bereich
	en:my great Section

After selecting a language labels can be the form fields in addition accumulate and structure
Tabs and Akkordions

@import(snips/.tabs_accordions.md)

##### Tooltips, Help-Texts and Placeholders

Should the field providing additional informations such as tooltips[^Tooltip], help-texts and placeholders[^ Placeholder] you have to write the Label aa little bit different.

* Tooltip: tooltip text in parentheses en:Field-Label (Tooltip text)
* Help text: path (starting from the end) to the help file in angle brackets en:Field-Label <path/to/the/file.md#optional_anchor>
* Placeholder: Placeholder text in square brackets en:Fiel-Label [Placeholder-text WITHOUT HTML]

[^Tooltip] : A tooltip is a little info bubble that appears when the mouse moves over the label. The label itself is highlighted as well.
[^Placeholder] : A placeholder is an information text that appears in the empty input-field.

Of course you can combine these Methods like this: 

	en:Field-Label (Tooltip text)[Placeholder-text WITHOUT HTML]<path/to/the/file.md#optional_anchor>

#### Data type

The data type will specify how the input box is drawn in the backend.
Depending on the type, additional parameters in the following field "wizard" can be stored.
If a wizard input field selected here may also specify a wizard.
The call is automatically written to the underlying field "addition".

Filter

Here you can define additional data filters such as

	FILTER_SANITIZE_EMAIL 

or

	FILTER_SANITIZE_SPECIAL_CHARS:FILTER_FLAG_STRIP_LOW 

more about filters: <http://www.php.net/manual/en/filter.filters.sanitize.php>

XSS protection in HTML output should be used in addition if required: http://htmlpurifier.org
Default Value

Here, a predefined value for a new entry is specified.
If the value of the term "function:" prefix, the field is with the PHP function call is given here
(examples can be found in the date fields).


#### Addition

Here you can define additional parameters for a box.

    Parameters for "data-" attributes with normal input fields (strings, numeric fields and text fields). Here, any information can be passed. Currently, the following attributes are considered in Javascript.
* mask: This attribute adds the field an input mask for a given input schema. Read more [here](http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin)  
        Sample input in addition field:
        mask: (999) 999-9999
* type: This forces a different input-type (hopefully in IE ..) for the field. HTML5 browser support (future) corresponding auxiliary functions.  
type:email
* Parameters for invoking a wizard: This usually happens on the selection of Wizards of the dropdown above and can be adapted here. (The large capitalized terms are placeholders below.)
  * wizard: WIZARD_NAME
  * param: ZUSÄTZLICHE_PARAMETER
  * icon: icon_name
  * label: LABEL_NAME 

#### Tags

The specification of tags is used to describe the field (this can be used eg to data structures automatically transferred to other systems).

#### Comment

A field for internal descriptions


## Relations

Entries be linked other entries in different objects with relations. The link mode is active when you click on the "id" field. When linking two objects you can choose:

* a "m:m" relation (or sibling relation) allows two elements to link with as many elements of the other object. If a relation painted linked to the (green) connector, the two id fields. Read more here .
* a "1:m" relation (or parent-child relation) allows to assign the dependent (child) element only one (parent) element of the other object. Here, the additional field "parent-object-name*id*" (the name of the parent object + "id") is created in the child object automatically.  
Note: If an additional integer-field named "parent-object-name*sort*" (the name of the parent object + "sort") is placed in the child object, the child-entries can be sorted. 

Meaning and purpose:

Let us create as a super-simple reference management. It has the three objects: "book", "author" and "publisher".

* an author may have written several books and a book may have been written by several authors. Here it is advisable to use a m:m relationship.
* a book is issued by one publisher. So, a 1:m relationship makes sense.

Exemplary modeling

![](img/buch.png)

About the encapsulation of informations in objects and the linking of elements can prevent that information must be entered twice. In addition, informations can be gathered with simple queries and views (eg "whitch books are published by a publisher").


## Notes

* A coherent data model should performs well and should be comfortable in the backend!
* if you want to realize exotic or highly "normalized" data models, it is advisable to define a corresponding structure with auxiliary objects and hooks. the even more elegant way is to do that via stored procedures / triggers, but these are database specific to apply.
* cms-kit saves the editable data model shown in the modeling-editor as a Json structure. The most current Json model can be found in the project directory in the file "objects/__draft.php". If a model is exported to the working model, it can be found JSON formated in the file "objects/__model.php".
